The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brassnumber four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their livingroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night whenMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only thephotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a largeblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing acomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that madethe first noise of the day. '), Document(page_content='Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. '), Document(page_content='Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. '), Document(page_content=' Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. '), Document(page_content='In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. '), Document(page_content=\" Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\"), Document(page_content=\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that laysmoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudleylooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like apig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.His face fell. \"), Document(page_content=' he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.'), Document(page_content=\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"), Document(page_content='All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing downhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, '), Document(page_content='So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,'), Document(page_content='Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. '), Document(page_content=' Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!'), Document(page_content='Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.'), Document(page_content='Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg hadbroken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. '), Document(page_content=' Uncle Vernon suggested.\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.'), Document(page_content=\"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"), Document(page_content='On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\"You could just leave me here,'), Document(page_content='And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.'), Document(page_content=' said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,'), Document(page_content='... and leave him in the car....\" \"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....'), Document(page_content=\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\"), Document(page_content='I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. '), Document(page_content=\" He shot Harry a nastygrin through the gap in his mother's arms. Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"), Document(page_content=\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind theirbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to thezoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"), Document(page_content=\"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now untilChristmas.\"), Document(page_content='I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly.. But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left '), Document(page_content='... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,'), Document(page_content=' said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.'), Document(page_content='MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered.I know they don\\'t,'), Document(page_content='Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge. '), Document(page_content=' Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.

He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- nocompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass tryingto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as abedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"), Document(page_content='I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him.

What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley wereleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back withhowls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed andstarted running for the exits.

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed AuntPetunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furioustelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someoneto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin bedsand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting onthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars andwondering.... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace wasdamp and empty. There were only two rooms.

The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harrywatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big asglowing coals. '), Document(page_content=' said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely.

All Harry\\'s -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known about this or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often hadthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep?

Harrylonged to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. '), Document(page_content=\" said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.

Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.

Barrels of slimy stuffstood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders linedthe walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himselfexamined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner onone of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, andDean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.

Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy wasstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passedQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ronhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\'s stutter.

The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brassnumber four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their livingroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night whenMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only thephotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a largeblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing acomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that madethe first noise of the day. '), Document(page_content='Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. '), Document(page_content='Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. '), Document(page_content=' Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. '), Document(page_content='In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. '), Document(page_content=\" Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\"), Document(page_content=\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that laysmoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudleylooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like apig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.His face fell. \"), Document(page_content=' he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.'), Document(page_content=\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"), Document(page_content='All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing downhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, '), Document(page_content='So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,'), Document(page_content='Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. '), Document(page_content=' Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!'), Document(page_content='Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.'), Document(page_content='Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg hadbroken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. '), Document(page_content=' Uncle Vernon suggested.\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.'), Document(page_content=\"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"), Document(page_content='On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\"You could just leave me here,'), Document(page_content='And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.'), Document(page_content=' said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,'), Document(page_content='... and leave him in the car....\" \"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....'), Document(page_content=\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\"), Document(page_content='I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. '), Document(page_content=\" He shot Harry a nastygrin through the gap in his mother's arms. Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"), Document(page_content=\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind theirbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to thezoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"), Document(page_content=\"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now untilChristmas.\"), Document(page_content='I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly.. But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left '), Document(page_content='... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,'), Document(page_content=' said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.'), Document(page_content='MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered.I know they don\\'t,'), Document(page_content='Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge. '), Document(page_content=' Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. '), Document(page_content=\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- nocompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass tryingto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as abedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"), Document(page_content='I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him.

Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley wereleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back withhowls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed andstarted running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"), Document(page_content=' The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,'), Document(page_content='Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you,Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.

'), Document(page_content='What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. '), Document(page_content=' she said.

'), Document(page_content=' He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began toopen the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. '), Document(page_content=' he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.'), Document(page_content='Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!'), Document(page_content='That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into asmile, which looked quite painful. '), Document(page_content='Why?\" said Harry. \"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. '), Document(page_content=\" The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), onewhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. Hesat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here wasbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, workingtank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in thecorner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his footthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bentbecause Dudley had sat on it.

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed AuntPetunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furioustelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someoneto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. '), Document(page_content=' Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. '), Document(page_content=' he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, '), Document(page_content='Out! OUT!\"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the lettersstill streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. '), Document(page_content=\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all backhere in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\"), Document(page_content='Shake\\'em off... shake \\'emoff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn\\'t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\\'d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\'dmissed five television programs he\\'d wanted to see, and he\\'d never goneso long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin bedsand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting onthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars andwondering.... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. '), Document(page_content=' She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:Mr. H.

Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\"), Document(page_content='Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all insidethe car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.

After what seemed likehours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace wasdamp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon\\'s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\\'t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.

Harry wentout into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as manyMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn\\'t have Mars Bars. Whatshe did have were Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\'s BestBlowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, LicoriceWands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. '), Document(page_content=' \"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, butHengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. \"), Document(page_content=' Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all theordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.

The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark greenhills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. Helooked tearful.

It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d belearning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening withoutnoticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrapthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making thecandles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on thegolden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.

And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows andwatched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It washolding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because itsarms were so long.

It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. '), Document(page_content=\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.

The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on itsface, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.

Amoment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waitingfor them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them lookingat each other, they all said '), Document(page_content='What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. '), Document(page_content=\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled.

'), Document(page_content='Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o\\'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner onone of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, andDean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playingin green). Wood cleared his throat for silence.

Out of thecorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashingPotter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
